 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * 
 * Dead mechanism definitions.
 * 
 * The dead mechanism is a way for a piece of code to detect whether some
 * specific event has occured during some operation (usually during calling
 * a user-provided handler function), without requiring access to memory
 * that might no longer be available because of the event.
 * 
 * It works somehow like that:
 * 
 * First a dead variable ({@link dead_t}) is allocated somewhere, and
 * initialized with {@link DEAD_INIT}, e.g.:
 *   DEAD_INIT(dead);
 * 
 * When the event that needs to be caught occurs, {@link DEAD_KILL} is
 * called, e.g.:
 *   DEAD_KILL(dead);
 * The memory used by the dead variable is no longer needed after
 * that.
 * 
 * If a piece of code needs to know whether the event occured during some
 * operation (but it must not have occured before!), it puts {@link DEAD_ENTER}}
 * in front of the operation, and does {@link DEAD_LEAVE} at the end. If
 * {@link DEAD_LEAVE} returned nonzero, the event occured, otherwise it did
 * not. Example:
 *   DEAD_ENTER(dead)
 *   HandlerFunction();
 *   if (DEAD_LEAVE(dead)) {
 *     (event occured)
 *   }
 * 
 * If is is needed to check for the event more than once in a single block,
 * {@link DEAD_DECLARE} should be put somewhere before, and {@link DEAD_ENTER2}
 * should be used instead of {@link DEAD_ENTER}.
 * 
 * If it is needed to check for multiple events (dead variables) at the same
 * time, DEAD_*_N macros should be used instead, specifying different
 * identiers as the first argument for different dead variables.
