 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * 
 * Definitions for FragmentProto, a protocol that allows sending of arbitrarily sized packets over
 * a link with a fixed MTU.
 * 
 * All multi-byte integers in structs are little-endian, unless stated otherwise.
 * 
 * A FragmentProto packet consists of a number of chunks.
 * Each chunk consists of:
 *   - the chunk header (struct {@link fragmentproto_chunk_header})
 *   - the chunk payload, i.e. part of the frame specified in the header
