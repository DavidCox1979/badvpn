 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * 
 * Definitions for SCProto, the protocol that the clients communicate in
 * with the server.
 * 
 * All multi-byte integers in structs are little-endian, unless stated otherwise.
 * 
 * A SCProto packet consists of:
 *   - a header (struct {@link sc_header}) which contains the type of the
 *     packet
 *   - the payload
 * 
 * It goes roughly like that:
 * 
 * When the client connects to the server, it sends a "clienthello" packet
 * to the server. The packet contains the protocol version the client is using.
 * When the server receives the "clienthello" packet, it checks the version.
 * If it doesn't match, it disconnects the client. Otherwise the server sends
 * the client a "serverhello" packet to the client. That packet contains
 * the ID of the client and possibly its IPv4 address as the server sees it
 * (zero if not applicable).
 * The server than proceeds to synchronize the peers' knowledge of each other.
 * It does that by sending a "newclient" messages to a client to inform it of
 * another peer, and "endclient" messages to inform it that a peer is gone.
 * The server forwards messages between synchronized peers to allow them to
 * communicate. A peer sends a message to another peer by sending the "outmsg"
 * packet to the server, and the server delivers a message to a peer by sending
 * it the "inmsg" packet.
